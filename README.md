# MVCMongo

A random project I've made to try making something sort of like an MVC design MongoDB REST API System using Node.JS, Express.JS, Mongoose and Swagger for the API-DOCS

This is a study project and is here so I can revisit this later, I'm turning this a public repository so people can also have a look into my code
